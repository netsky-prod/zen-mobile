/*
 * iOS Project Configuration Notes
 *
 * To complete iOS setup, you need to:
 *
 * 1. Open the project in Xcode on a Mac
 * 
 * 2. Add the PacketTunnel extension target:
 *    - File > New > Target > Network Extension
 *    - Choose "Packet Tunnel Provider"
 *    - Bundle ID: com.zen.security.PacketTunnel
 *
 * 3. Configure App Groups:
 *    - Add "group.com.zen.security" to both targets
 *    - This allows sharing data between app and extension
 *
 * 4. Add Network Extension capability:
 *    - Select Runner target
 *    - Signing & Capabilities > + Capability > Network Extensions
 *    - Enable "Packet Tunnel"
 *
 * 5. Add libbox.xcframework:
 *    - Build libbox for iOS: make lib_ios
 *    - Drag Libbox.xcframework into Xcode
 *    - Add to both targets
 *
 * 6. Configure entitlements:
 *    - Runner.entitlements needs:
 *      - com.apple.developer.networking.networkextension
 *      - com.apple.security.application-groups
 *    - PacketTunnel.entitlements needs the same
 *
 * 7. For distribution:
 *    - You need an Apple Developer account
 *    - Network Extension requires special entitlements from Apple
 *    - For personal use, sideloading via AltStore works
